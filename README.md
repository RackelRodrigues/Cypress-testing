# Cypress Practice Tests

This repository contains practice tests created while learning **Cypress**, a powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications.  
It serves as a playground to explore Cypress commands, techniques, and best practices.

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

- Simple examples for basic **interactions and assertions**
- UI tests interacting with elements on the **Playground site**
- **API tests** using `cy.request()`
- Tests executed via **Docker containers** for isolated environments
- Clean, organized structure using **Page Object Design Pattern**

## Purpose

This project is dedicated to **learning and experimenting** with Cypress, improving my testing skills, and understanding how to automate complex web interactions efficiently.
