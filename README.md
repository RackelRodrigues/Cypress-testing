This repository contains practice tests created while learning **Cypress**, a powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications.  
It serves as a playground to explore Cypress commands, techniques, and best practices.

## What you'll find here

- Tests interacting with **UI components** on the Playground site.

## Purpose

This project is dedicated to **learning and experimenting** with Cypress, improving my testing skills, and understanding how to automate complex web interactions efficiently.
